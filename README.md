# Fire Emblem Heroes App

A simple mobile/web app that allows the user to view their allies.
The purpose is to gain more experience with Ionic 2 + Angular as well as enjoy the art of the game. :)


As of 2/18/17:
  - Users can *add*, and *delete* allies.
  - Users can input the *rarity* and *level* for the allies.
  - Users can view the allies in a 3-columned grid.
  - Icons are shown for _allies, rarity, weapon type, and movement_
